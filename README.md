## 🚨 Accident Alert System – Project Description

### ✅ **Project Title:**

**Accident Alert and Reporting System using IoT**

---

### 📝 **Project Description:**

The **Accident Alert System** is a real-time IoT-based safety project designed to detect road accidents and immediately alert emergency contacts and services. It uses sensors like accelerometer and GPS to identify sudden impacts, determine the vehicle's location, and send an automated alert through a GSM module or internet. This system helps reduce the delay in emergency response, potentially saving lives by ensuring immediate attention to accident victims.

This project is suitable for smart transportation, school buses, public transport, and private vehicles, and is often implemented in embedded systems, IoT, or electronics/CS final-year projects.

## ⚙️ How It Works – Process Flow

### 🔹 **1. Accident Detection**

* An **accelerometer sensor** (like MPU6050 or ADXL345) detects sudden shock, tilt, or impact.
* The **microcontroller** (e.g., Arduino, ESP32, or Raspberry Pi) monitors these values.
* When values exceed a set threshold, it assumes a collision or accident has occurred.

---

### 🔹 **2. Data Gathering**

* A **GPS module** (e.g., Neo-6M) fetches the real-time **latitude and longitude**.
* The **time and date** are recorded automatically.
* Optional: Vehicle number, driver ID, speed, and other details.

---

### 🔹 **3. Alert Generation**

* The system triggers an **automatic alert**:

  * **Sends an SMS** to emergency contacts using a **GSM module** (e.g., SIM800L).
  * Or **uploads data to an IoT server** (e.g., Firebase, Blynk, or ThingSpeak).
  * Optional: Sends a **WhatsApp message, push notification**, or **makes a phone call**.

---

### 🔹 **4. Emergency Response**

* The alert contains:

  * Message like: “🚨 Accident detected! Location: \[Lat, Long]”
  * Map link for easy access.
* Emergency services or family can reach the spot quickly using the shared location.

---

### 🔹 **5. Manual Cancel Option (Optional)**

* A **button** or **mobile app interface** is included.
* If it’s a false alarm, the user can cancel the alert within 10–20 seconds.
